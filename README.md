👋 Hello there! I’m Derek!
- I'm a sophomore majoring in Computer Science and Biology at McGill University.
- I'm interested in coding to solve problems in biology (genomics/bioinformatics, brain MRI image analysis for traumatic brain injuries).
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm a multi-instrumentalist (piano, drums, a little bit of guitar).
