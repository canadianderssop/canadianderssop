ðŸ‘‹ Hello there! Iâ€™m Derek!
- I'm currently a Junior majoring in Computer Science and Biology at McGill University.
- I'm interested in coding to solve problems in biology (pharmaceutical/disease research) and music tech (applications in cognition, perception and movement). 
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm a multi-instrumentalist (piano, drums, a little bit of guitar).
